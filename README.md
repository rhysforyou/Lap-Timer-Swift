This project was done as part of a mobile development course at my university,
so some of the moreâ€¦ interesting UI decisions are a result of that project
spec. This was one of my first Swift projects, and a great learning experience.

## Building

This project builds in the latest Xcode release (6.0.1) as of writing
(2014-10-12), but Swift is in a constant state of change, so this may not be
the case in the future. I'll try to update the project as new versions of Xcode
come out, but it's not a major priority for me.
